ToolipsDefaults contains default styles, stylesheets, Components, and compositions which can be easily integrated with your [toolips](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Toolips.jl) project. This can be a quick way to start and organize a project with some basics. 
##### styles

##### components

##### other

##### more UI packages
There are more options coming that will also provide similar UI elements to this package. Whenever I get through the other things I am doing, and get around to building many of them, I will put them here :)
